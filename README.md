Hello and welcome to my github page :)!<br>

I am currently working on a project to help families stay synced while working from home. <br>
Check it out here: <a href="https://github.com/marissaromero/ourHouse">OurHouse</a>

I also have a couple of on-going group projects from recent hackathons: 

<a href="https://github.com/eloquize">Eloquize</a> - an app to gamify behavioral interview practice

<a href="https://github.com/Rooting-For-U/rooting-for-you">Rooting For You</a> - an app to help track watering your house plants
